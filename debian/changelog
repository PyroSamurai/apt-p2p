apt-p2p (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix: no files were added to the DHT due to missing hashing results.
  * Lower the timeout to 9 sec to reduce delays.
  * Be more careful about which nodes get added to the routing table
    - Only add nodes to the routing table that have responded to a request.
    - Don't try and add ourself to the routing table during an action.
    - Don't add local IP addresses to the routing table (with config
      option to override).
    - Fix the broken local IP regexes.
  * Don't log KRPC errors for receiving an invalid store_value token.
