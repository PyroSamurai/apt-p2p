    directories).
  * Download from peers using the hash instead of a directory location.
  * Don't add files to the DHT if a hash could not be found for them.
  * Use python-debian for parsing RFC 822 files (untested).

  * Another new TODO item: better DHT lookups for multiple values per
    key.
  * Added 2 (commented) failed attempts to throttle the web server.
