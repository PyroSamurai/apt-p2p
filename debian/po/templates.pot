"It is VERY important that Apt-P2P's ports be reachable by other peers. This "
"is needed both to share files with others, and to connect to others through "
"the DHT to find peers for files. If you aren't accessible by others, you "
"will not only not share anything, but your performance during downloading "
"will be affected."

"Apt-P2P uses a default port of 9977, over both TCP and UDP, for it's "
"communication. You can change this port in the /etc/apt-p2p/apt-p2p.conf "
"file, and use different ports for TCP and UDP, if desired. Whatever port you "
"use, make sure to forward it through your NAT or firewall to improve your "
"performance and share with others. Information on port forwarding can be "
"found here:"
