Description: apt helper for peer-to-peer downloads of Debian packages
 Apt-P2P is a helper for downloading Debian packages files with APT.
 It will download any needed files from other Apt-P2P peers in a
 peer-to-peer manner, and so reduce the strain on the Debian mirrors.
 .
 The Apt-P2P daemon runs automatically on startup and listens for
 requests from APT for files, as well as maintaining membership in a
 Distributed Hash Table (DHT). For any files which have a hash
 available (most files), peers that have the file are looked for in the
 DHT. The file can then be downloaded from them, using the uploading
 bandwidth of other peers while reducing the demand on the Debian mirror
 network. However, if a package can not be found on any peers, Apt-P2P
 will fall back to downloading from a mirror to ensure all packages are
 downloaded. Once downloaded, the file is hash checked and added to the
 DHT so that other peers can download it without the mirror.
 .
 The configuration is very simple, and only involves prepending
 'localhost' and the port to your current sources.list lines (similar
 to other apt-proxy-like software).
