Apt-DHT: a peer-to-peer proxy for apt downloads

### Goal

Similar to DebTorrent[1], Apt-DHT will act as a proxy between apt
requests and a debian repository server, downloading any requested
files from peers (if possible), but falling back to a direct HTTP
download. Unlike DebTorrent, Apt-DHT will be simple, efficient, and
fast.

### Features

* Downloads from peers, increasing the available bandwidth to the 
  user
* Reduces the bandwidth requirements needed to setup a repository 
  of packages
* Seamlessly integrates with the current APT tool
* Automatically falls back to downloading from an HTTP mirror when 
  peers are not available
* Builds on other already existing tools where possible
* Fast and requires limited CPU and memory
* Will try to download any file it can find a hash for from peers
  (including Packages.bz2, Sources.gz, ...)

This software is open-source and is released at no charge under the 
terms of the GPL v2 license[2].

### Requirements

To run the full program (e.g. to actually download something):

* Python 2.4 or higher
* Twisted[3] 2.4 or higher
  - including Twisted Web2[4] 0.2 or higher
* python-apt[5] 0.6.20 or higher
* An APT-based package management system (such as Debian distributions 
  have)

If you just want to run the DHT part of the program (e.g. to provide a
bootstrap node), then you only need:

* Python 2.4 or higher
* Twisted[3] 2.4 or higher

### Development Status

This project is still undergoing massive code and protocol changes
and hasn't yet seen a release. The code has worked, and is
occasionally working, and will definitely be working soon in the
future.

### Installing

There are detailed instructions on the web site[6] showing how to
install the Apt-DHT program. If you have any trouble using the
program, you can email me[7], or come and find me in the
DebTorrent IRC channel (#debtorrent on OFTC[8]). If you think
you've found a bug in the program, please let me know.

### The Code

The latest code for the project is currently hosted in a Git 
repository[9]. It is publicly readable, and there are instructions
there for downloading the code. It is originally based on the
khashmir[10] implementation of the kademlia DHT[11]. All of the
networking is handled by the Twisted and Twisted Web2
libraries. Dealing with apt's repository files is handled by
python-apt, the code for which is based on that of the
apt-proxy[12] program.
