<p><strong>Article submitted by Cameron Dale. Guess what? We still need
you to <a href="http://debaday.debian.net/contribute/">submit good
articles about software you like</a>!</strong></p>

<p>Do you want to help out the Debian (or Ubuntu) project with some
mirror bandwidth but don't know how? Do you want to contribute somehow
to Debian's infrastructure, but you're not a coder? Tired of getting
slow download speeds when the mirrors are overloaded after a new
release? Then Apt-P2P is for you.</p>

<p>After installing the apt-p2p package and making some minor changes to
apt's sources, all the files you download with apt (or aptitude,
synaptic, gnome-apt, etc...) will be shared with other users, and any
files you download will use other users (peers) to download from.
However, if no other users have the file you want there's no need to
worry, Apt-P2P will happily fall back to downloading directly from the
mirror so your download will not fail.<p>

<h4>How it works</h4>

<p>The main operation of Apt-P2P is the maintenance of a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">Distributed
Hash Table (DHT)</a> used to find and store peers to download from for
each file. Whenever you download a file, apt-2p will first lookup the
SHA1 hash of the file in the DHT. If it is found and has peers listed,
then the downloading will occur from the peers (if there are only 1 or 2
peers, the mirror is used as well to speed up the download). If it is
not found then the file is requested directly from the mirror. Once the
download is complete, a new value is added to the DHT using the SHA1
hash of the file as the key, and including your contact info, so that
other peers can then find you to download the file from.</p>

<p>That's just a brief overview, but there are many hidden details that
make things go smoother. For example, for larger files the SHA1 hashes
of pieces of the file are stored in the DHT as well, which allows
downloaders to break up large files among several peers to get better
download speeds (similar to BitTorrent). For more information, you can
go to the Apt-P2P home page:
<a href="http://www.camrdale.org/apt-p2p/">http://www.camrdale.org/apt-p2p/</a>.</p>

<h4>Statistics</h4>

<p>Since Apt-P2P is a daemon, it doesn't have any user interface for a
nice screenshot. However, if you go to
<a href="http://localhost:9977/">http://localhost:9977/</a> in your
browser on the machine Apt-P2P is running on, you will get a nice
display of various statistics. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total amount downloaded and uploaded this session.</li>
<li>Total amount downloaded and uploaded for all time.</li>
<li>Amount downloaded broken up into mirrors and other users.</li>
<li>Number of files being shared.</li>
<li>Number of DHT keys and values being stored for other peers.</li>
<li>Amount downloaded and uploaded in DHT messages.</li>
<li>Number of DHT peers in contact and an estimated total number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't be discouraged if you don't upload much to, or download much
from, other peers yet. Apt-P2P is still young and needs more people to
use it to increase the chances of finding peers for files. Tell your
friends!</p>

<h4>Comparison with other P2P programs</h4>

Other than <a href="http://debtorrent.alioth.debian.org/">DebTorrent<a>,
there aren't any other peer-to-peer downloaders available for apt. There
was <a href="http://sianka.free.fr/">apt-torrent<a>, but it was never
packaged in Debian, and now seems to be dead (no updates in 18 months).
Comparing Apt-P2P with DebTorrent, Apt-P2P:

<ul>
<li>Is faster at downloading from mirrors.</li>
<li>Uses much less memory and a little less CPU.</li>
<li>Can download almost all files (source files,
<kbd>Packages.bz2</kbd>, etc...) from peers, not just <kbd>.deb</kbd>
packages.</li>
<li>Works with only the information apt has, no need for other
files.</li>
<li>Doesn't require a new apt transport for communicating with apt.</li>
<li>Is more modular and easier to understand as it is based on existing
technologies (e.g. <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">twisted<a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Setup</h4>

<p>Apt-P2P is available in testing (lenny) and unstable (sid), and will
be available in Intrepid for Ubuntu. It can be installed by
<kbd>aptitude install apt-p2p</kbd>.</p>

<p>Setting up apt to use Apt-P2P as a proxy is easy, especially if you
have used other proxy software (e.g. apt-proxy, apt-cacher, approx) in
the past. The configuration change is the same, simply adding a
<kbd>localhost:9977/</kbd> to the front of the entries in your
<kbd>/etc/apt/sources.list</kbd> file. For example, if you previously
had this:

<pre class="terminal"># Official
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free

# Security Updates
deb http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib non-free

# Unofficial
deb http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted
deb-src http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted

# Backports
deb http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free
deb-src http://www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free</pre>

<p>Then, if you only want to share the official and backported packages,
you would change it to this:</p>

<pre class="terminal"># Official
deb http://localhost:9977/ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free
deb-src http://localhost:9977/ftp.us.debian.org/debian etch main contrib non-free

# Security Updates
deb http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ etch/updates main contrib non-free

# Unofficial
deb http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted
deb-src http://ftp.debian-unofficial.org/debian etch main contrib non-free restricted

# Backports
deb http://localhost:9977/www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free
deb-src http://localhost:9977/www.backports.org/debian etch-backports main contrib non-free</pre>

<p>Then, run an <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> and start installing
packages.</p>

<p>It's also <strong>VERY</strong> important to set up port forwarding
if your machine is behind a firewall or router/NAT. More information on
how to determine if you are connectable can be
