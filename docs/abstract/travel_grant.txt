###  Research Interests  ###

My current research is focussed mainly on BitTorrent. One aspect I have
studied is the effectiveness of the rarest-first policy to evenly
distribute pieces of the download throughout the peers. I have found
that the policy is mostly effective at maintaining a near-optimal piece
population distribution, though there are some areas for improvement.

I have also examined the different network topologies formed between
peers in a BitTorrent swarm. Some of the networks I have found to have
scale-free behaviour, verifying the resilience of the swarm to the
failures and departures that are common in all peer-to-peer networking
scenarios. Others that were previously thought to have small-world
characteristics, I have found to contain very little clustering. I have
therefore designed an enhancement to the BitTorrent tracker to introduce
clustering and create a small-world from the BitTorrent swarm, which
should improve the effectiveness of the BitTorrent protocol at
distributing the download to peers.

In collaboration with another student, Xu Cheng, we have studied the
video sharing site YouTube. This new type of video distribution has not
seen much research yet, and we find some interesting differences between
it and traditional video distribution. My work focussed mostly on the
social networking aspect of YouTube, which is unique among video sharing
sites. The results showed that YouTube videos form a small-world
network, which suggests that videos are strongly correlated with each
other. This feature can be used to develop interesting caching or
peer-to-peer distribution strategies for videos.

###  Plans for Future Research  ###

Using my previous work on BitTorrent as a foundation, I am currently
working on a new peer-to-peer download system for distributors of free
content (mostly software packages) over the web. The system uses a
Distributed Hash Table to support downloading the individual content
files from peers, which reduces the strain on the network of mirrors
that is usually required to support the downloads. This work includes
implementing a new download client for software packages of Debian-based
systems called apt-p2p.

My plans are to complete the work on the design of the system, and the
implementation and deployment of the client. I will then be analyzing
and improving both, to determine their effectiveness at solving this
problem and to make them suitable for any free content distributors to
use.

Finally, I will be preparing and defending my thesis.
