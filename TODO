Change all print statements to log.msg() calls.


Add ability to search and hash and DHT-store other directories.

The user should be able to specify a list of directories that will be 
searched for files to hash and add to the DHT.


Missing Kademlia implementation details are needed.

The current implementation is missing some important features, mostly 
focussed on storing values:
 - values need to be republished (every hour?)
 - original publishers need to republish values (every 24 hours)
 - when a new node is found that is closer to some values, replicate the 
   values there without deleting them
 - when a value lookup succeeds, store the value in the closest node 
   found that didn't have it
 - make the expiration time of a value exponentially inversely 
   proportional to the number of nodes between the current node and the 
   node closest to the value
