Missing Kademlia implementation details are needed.

The current implementation is missing some important features, mostly 
focussed on storing values:
 - values need to be republished (every hour?)
 - original publishers need to republish values (every 24 hours)
 - when a new node is found that is closer to some values, replicate the 
   values there without deleting them
 - when a value lookup succeeds, store the value in the closest node 
   found that didn't have it
 - make the expiration time of a value exponentially inversely 
   proportional to the number of nodes between the current node and the 
   node closest to the value
